Will make a picture with fancybox

![](./picture.png)
*With caption*

Will make a picture with caption (fancybox too)

![](./hey.pdf)
*caption*

- "*.pdf" is the logic

Will make a pdf preview with caption (can also omit caption)

[file reference](./myfile.txt)
    - Key is "./" before file, that's what triggers it
Will make a downloadable link to the file you specify
