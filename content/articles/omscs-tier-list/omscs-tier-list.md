## Criteria
  
The critera are:

1. How well-presented is the class?
2. How hands-on is the class?
3. What are the class mechanics like?

## The classes I took

1. [Knowledge-based AI](#knowledge-based-ai)
2. [Reinforcement Learning](#reinforcement-learning)
3. [Robotics](#robotics)
4. [Machine Learning for Trading](#machine-learning-for-trading)
5. [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
6. [AI](#ai)
7. [Computer Networks](#computer-networks)
8. [Human-Computer Interaction](#human-computer-interaction)
9. [AI, Ethics and Society](#ai-ethics-and-society)
10. [Grad Algos](#graduate-algorithms)
11. [Software Development Process](#software-development-process)

## Knowledge-based AI

- Well-presented?
    - Yes, of course, it's a Joyner class!
- Hands-on?
    - Yes, it's actually quite a lot coding, and has some really cool projects
- Class mechanics
    - Yes, very well organized
- Tier? **A**

## Reinforcement Learning

- Well-presented?
    - Yes, it is well presented (although very tough stuff!)
- Hands-on?
    - Sort-of hands on. Alot more reading than coding/building in this class
- Class mechanics
    - Yes, great interaction with the TAs on EdStem, however, grading was very subjective and slow to get back to the students
- Tier? **B**

## Robotics

- Well-presented?
    - Yes!! This class rocks!!
    - It was very cool videos and stuff, really neat stuff.
- Hands-on?
    - Yes, you do a bunch of cool projects in this class
- Class mechanics
    - Nothing to write home about, but still pretty good
- Tier? **S**

## Machine learning for trading

- Well-presented?
    - Yes, it is a bit slow in the content (it's tough but also, I think simplified for our beginning status as students in stock trading haha)
- Hands-on?
    - Yes, you actually do a lot of coding and building in this class
- Class mechanics
    - Good
- Tier? **B**

## Machine learning

- Well-presented?
    - Very well presented content
- Hands-on?
    - Tedium honestly, not super hands-on it felt.
    - Felt like a lot of busy work
- Class mechanics
    - Pretty ambiguous and mysterious grading! Good luck!
- Tier? **C**

## AI

- Well-presented?
    - Yes! It was super cool
- Hands-on?
    - Yes!! Super intense programming here! Seriously, tough programming.
- Class mechanics
    - Yes there was actually the most feedback and participation from any of the other clases. (Maybe beacause it's so hard, students just had to come together to get through it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚)
- Tier? **A**

## Computer networks

- Well-presented?
    - Yes, it was a bit dry sometimes (I mean the topic itself can be dry haha)
- Hands-on?
    - Yes, there was actually 1 really good lab (the first), that was relevant to networking (I use it in my job as a networking engineer)
- Class mechanics
    - Yeah
- Tier? **B**

## Human-computer interaction

- Well-presented?
    - Yeah, it's interesting, but pretty simplistic/obvious
- Hands-on?
    - You do a lot of writing in this class, but it is pretty busy work-y. Mostly writing papers.
- Class mechanics
    - Yeah there's a lot of support for students in this class (it's a Joyner class)
- Tier? **C**

## AI, Ethics and Society

- Well-presented?
    - Yeah I think so
- Hands-on?
    - A bit fluffy
- Class mechanics
    - Yeah pretty chill
- Tier? **C**

## Graduate Algorithms

- Well-presented?
    - Well I didn't finish it so ðŸ˜‚ but the lecture videos were actually really cool
- Hands-on?
    - It used to not be, but I have heard it is getting better.
    - ![](./Psuedocode.png)
- Class mechanics
    - Not great at all ðŸ˜‚ (well sort of, like a "C" level)
- Tier? **D**

## Software Development Process

- Well-presented?
    - Yeah, it actually was
- Hands-on?
    - Yes, the way you do the group project is **very similar** to how you do real software-engineering
- Class mechanics
    - Yeah it did feel like TAs/professors did get back
- Tier? **A**
