-- Misc --
When removing atoms, in build.go there was a video thingy
With Fragments, there was a "content/fragments-drafts" and "content/fragments-defunct"

-- Maybe maybe haha --
Eventually make it so year bar shows even when clicking button (and filtering them out/back in)

-- Could never do: --
Link in figure captions ❌
    - It gets super-imposed by fancy box, would need to change fancybox
Make it so single # is header ❌
    - It then makes headers out of single "#" code comments
Remove weird newline constraint on headers ❌
    - You can, but then the text isn't in <p> Tags
    - Would need to change blackfriday
Figure out linting once and for all ❌
    - IDK if it happens again we'll deal with it lols

-- Dev notes: --
We have slugification in 3 places:
    - mmarkdownnext.go to slugify "##" headers
    - search.ts - tagToURL to link tags in search results
    - article.sh - slugify new article idea
